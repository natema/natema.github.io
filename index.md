I am a [CNRS] researcher (HDR) at [Université
Côte d’Azur][UCA], a [3IA Côte d'Azur][3IA] Chair and a member of the [COATI
Project-Team][COATI] between [INRIA] and [I3S][I3S].

### About me

Before accepting a CNRS position in 2018, I've been a fellow of the [*Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing*](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) in the Brain and Computation Program and a postdoctoral fellow at the [*Max Planck Institute for Informatics*](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/algorithms-complexity).
In 2019, I've received the *Best Italian Young Researcher in Theoretical Computer Science* award by the Italian Chapter of the European Association of Theoretical Computer Science, from which I also received the *Best PhD Thesis in Theoretical Computer Science* in 2017. In 2016, I've been a recipient of the *Best Student Paper Award* at the European Symposium on Algorithms.
For more information (projects, academic service etc.), see my [CV](/cv/).

### Research

I'm interested in machine learning and neuroscience, with a focus on theoretical aspects of multi-agent systems and artificial neural networks.
I give a quick overview of my research [here](/research/#research_bio).
