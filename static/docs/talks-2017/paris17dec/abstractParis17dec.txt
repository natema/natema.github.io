We present analytical results regarding some simple randomized protocols,
called dynamics, for solving fundamental distributed consensus problems,
together with examples on how to use them to build lightweight
algorithms for other important distributed problems.
More specifically, we provide an overview of the theory regarding several
dynamics such as the 3-Majority, the Averaging and the Undecided-State ones,
and we show how to use them to solve plurality consensus, distributed
clustering, clock synchronization and information spreading. 
Motivated by applications to systems whose complexity is in-between biological
and human-made ones, we focus mainly on unstructured and random interaction
models, and we also deal with scenarios in which the communication is affected
by noise or when a self-stabilizing protocol is required.
